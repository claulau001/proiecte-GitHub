### Description

Imagine this situation: you are with your friends somewhere out and the boredom makes its appearance. Everyone wants to do something different and go to different places. Lucky for you that you have an amazing game of Ping-Pong that will enjoy everyone. All they had to do is to move the paddle with the help of a potentiometer and try to hit the ball.

This project was done in 2023 as a project for "Linear Electronic Circuits" course.
